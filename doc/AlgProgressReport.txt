Have:

dataset
noise filter
bounding box
resizing
rough main client class
-store resulting values in heap
-remove max/min from heap k times for k closest neighbors

idea on how to get primary axis and rotate the image
-get image contour (when runs change)
-resize using bounding box
-divide image into k subquadrants
-go through subsections on the perimeter
-if a colored pixel found, go to radially opposite subsection and search for pixel
-if pixel found, calculate distance and slope
repeat above 3 times
get primary axis
rotate


Don't have:
How to pre-categorize images?
rotate by contour and do a scan-line-fill?
